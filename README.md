1.Used the stdio.h library file for input and output functions.
2.Initialized the integer variables N,c,d and key.
3.Read and display the number of elements in an array.
4.Checked whether the condition if N>o or not,if N>0 then followed the below steps or else go to step 11
5.The array is declared and input values are given dynamically into the array.
6.Insertion logic starts here,using the for condition iterate the values in the array from a[1] to a[n].
7.Compare the present element[key]to its previous value. 
3:If the key element is smaller than its previous , compare it to the elements present before.
9.Then Move the greater value elements by one place up for the element to be swapped.
10.By using the print function display the sorted array in the accending order.
11.So,if there are no elements in the array print "no elements in the array".
